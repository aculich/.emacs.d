# My personal Emacs configuration #

Based heavily on (e.g. forked directly from) Sebastian Wiesner's awesome Emacs setup: https://github.com/lunaryorn/.emacs.d

With many awesome additions (such as the most-excellent [skewer-mode](https://github.com/skeeto/.emacs.d#skewer)) taken from Christopher Wellons's configs: https://github.com/skeeto/.emacs.d


Makes extensive use of [use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package).

Also, I prefer using [Cask](https://github.com/cask/cask) to install packages rather than rely on use-package to download and byte-compile the packages. When dealing with a large number of packages it can be frustrating to have one byte-compilation snafu that aborts the initial (often lengthy) first-time setup process‚Äì‚Äì forcing you to restart the process all over again.

## Setup ‚Äî How do you use it? ##

You need Emacs 25 snapshot builds, straight from Git `master`.  Stable releases of GNU Emacs won‚Äôt work, I¬†build GNU Emacs weekly.

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/lunaryorn/.emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
$ brew install trash coreutils
$ brew install aspell --with-lang-en
$ cd ~/.emacs.d && cask install
```

plus all the standard tools for all the various programming languages (`sbt`, `hlint`, `stack`, `pandoc`, `pylint` and stuff).  Read the comments in `init.el` for more information.

## Layout ‚Äî Where do you find things? ##

It‚Äôs¬†a single big `init.el`, containing only `use-package` declarations for all the built-in and 3rd party packages I¬†use.  These declarations have all the configuration and setup for the specific packages.

There‚Äôs¬†also `lisp/` which has many of [lunaryorn‚Äôs](https://github.com/lunaryorn/.emacs.d) personal extensions and libraries with custom functions, etc.  These libraries are loaded like normal packages with `use-package` in `init.el`. Much of the code is useful and I would like to generalize it in the future, but for now it contain‚Äôs the lunaryorn namespace prefix.

## Highlights ‚Äî What you should probably copy from this! ##

- Very good OS X support, even with stock GNU Emacs, including a font setup that supports Math, Symbols and Coloured Emojis (yay üòç)
- A¬†well-designed key bindings scheme, inspired by [Spacemacs][], supported by
  [Which Key Mode][] and [Hydra][]
- Rules for buffer displays in `display-buffer-alist`
- A¬†very powerful and comprehensive LaTeX setup with [AUCTeX][]
- Nice configurations for Scala (with [Ensime][]), Emacs Lisp and a couple of
  other languages
- Built-in web server you can launch with `httpd-start` and stop it with `httpd-stop`. It will serve files from the directory at `httpd-root` and log messages in s-expression form to the `*httpd*` buffer.
- [Skewer][] provides a JavaScript REPL (`skewer-repl`) and live expression evaluation in JavaScript buffers of an external web browser attached to the built-in web server running in Emacs. It can also do live "evaluation" of CSS (`skewer-css-mode`) and HTML (`skewer-html-mode`).
